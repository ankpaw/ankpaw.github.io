      <p>
        Hello! My name is Ankit. Since my first encounter with computers,
        I&apos;ve been captivated by their potential. The intersection of this
        fascination and my knack for problem-solving led me to the world of
        software development, a space I&apos;m deeply passionate about.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Early Steps</h2>
      <p>
        My journey began in 2017 when I discovered competitive programming. This
        arena honed my analytical thinking and kindled my love for algorithmic
        challenges. During this time, I had the privilege of becoming a campus
        ambassador for HackerEarth, which further solidified my connection to
        the tech community.

      <p>
        My journey has been diverse and enriching. From startups to Fortune 500
        companies, I&apos;ve embraced the spectrum of software development
        experiences. I&apos;ve worked with large and small development teams,
        navigated projects with and without constraints, and learned from both
        small startups and corporate giants.

        As a UI Engineer at HUB, I&apos;ve played a vital role in building an
        asset management platform, making individual contributions that matter.
        During my tenure at Syfe, I contributed as a Mid-level UI Engineer,
        actively shaping an investment management platform.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Leading and Building</h2>

        At Meddo Health, I led the frontend development effort as a Team Lead.
        This role allowed me to guide the development of an e-commerce platform
        catering to India&apos;s healthcare market.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Fortifying Skills</h2>
      <p>
        As a Full Stack Software Engineer at MAQ Software, I honed my skills by
        developing web applications for Fortune 500 clients in data analytics
        and services.
